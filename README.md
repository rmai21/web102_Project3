## Notes

The main challenges dealth with knowing how to use the click features. The other was styling. I had trouble with some CSS features based on location. Where the items were being placed on the screen. Instead of a random feature. There is more structure in this version. There are two buttons, a previous and a next to go forward and background to get more out of studying.
